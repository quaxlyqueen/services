A simple utility for quickly spinning up a web server.

Usage:
Copy to /usr/local/bin to install the script and allow it to be ran from anywhere.
Alternatively, keep the script in ~/utils, and use full filepaths as parameters.

`servePage`
`servePage -o 10000`
`servePage -p /home/USERNAME/WEBPAGE_DIR`
`servePage -d /home`

-o = PORT
-p = PATH
-D = DEST

More customization to come in the future, and more options such as self-hosting an API.
